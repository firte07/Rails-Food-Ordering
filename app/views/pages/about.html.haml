        We are committed to uniting fresh, locally grown produce with farm-raised and wild-caught seafood to make the freshest dishes you’ll find anywhere.
        Our signature raw bar offers a variety of Rhode Island oysters, crisp cherrystones, littleneck clams, and jumbo shrimp
        and many of our herbs and vegetables are grown in our vegetable farm on the north end of the pond.
